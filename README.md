# Adult-Income
To build a machine learning model and Classify Salary of empolyees whether less than 50K or greater than 50K from various aspects (education, marital-status, occupation, race, and some more..)
This dataset is randomly created to show  comparing different models of different companies, model to predict the salary of an employee based on years of experience.
This dataset consists of fifteen columns
income- Represent the salary of a person whether less than 50K or greater than 50K
This project aims at finding the best model to predict if the income of an individual is greater than 50K based on the data provided by the UCI Machine learning repository called the ‘Adult dataset’ by investigating various pattern recognition techniques. 
The predictor variables include information such as age, education, occupation, gender, native country and other relevant information of an individual.
The approach included data pre-processing wherein missing data, categorical feature representation, normalization .
Also, various pattern recognition techniques- both distribution-free and statistical classification techniques were implemented.
